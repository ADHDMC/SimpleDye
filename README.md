# SimpleDye

Did you ever feel like dyeing leather armor was a pain? Of course you didn't! That is why I made a solution for it anyway!

This plugin was originally intended for use on ADHDMC.

## Commands

`/sd simple <color>`

- Choose from a wide array of colors provided to you by the DyeColors Enum!
- Requires the `simpledye.simple` or `simpledye.*` permission ~~or you can be op, but we don't talk about that~~.

`/sd rgb <hex>`

- Or decide you are too fancy for that and need specific color mixing!
- Supports `RRGGBB` format or `#RRGGBB` but not #RGB / RGB format because you ~~~~can type out 6 characters, don't be lazy...
- Requires the `simpledye.rgb` or `simpledye.*` permission ~~or you can be op, but we- never mind, I think you get the point.~~.
